ros-noetic-fuse-publishers (0.4.1-1buster) buster; urgency=high

  * Fixing license
  * Support throttling serialized graph publisher (#204 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse/issues/204>)
    * Change sensor proc from gtest to gmock target
    * Move ThrottledCallback to fuse_core
    * Support generic callbacks in ThrottledCallback
    * Throttle graph publishing
    * Overload getPositiveParam for ros::Duration
    * Use getPositiveParam for ros::Duration parameters
  * Set latch param in serialized publisher to false by default (#184 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse/issues/184>)
  * Add latch param to serialized publisher (#165 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse/issues/165>)
  * Use transaction stamp in SerializedPublisher (#147 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse/issues/147>)
    By using the transaction stamp instead of ros::Time::now() it's
    possible to replay things with the same transaction and compare the
    original and new generated graphs.
  * Removed the explicit '-std=c++14' compile flag (#119 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse/issues/119>)
