  * Getting versions in sync
  * Substract minimum twist covariance from twist covariance (#222 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse/issues/222>)
    * Substract min twist cov from twist cov
    If the twist covariance already had a minimum twist covariance added to
    it to prevent ill-conditioned covariance matrices, we need a way to
    substract that minimum twist covariance from it before we compute the
    pose relative covariance. Otherwise, we cannot get the original pose
    relative covariance because the minimum twist covariance term is
    multiplies by the time delta, which could actually make the resulting
    pose relative covariance ill-conditioned or very small, i.e.
    overconfident.
  * [Issue #223 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse/issues/223>] Add an optional tf_timeout parameter to the sensor models (#224 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse/issues/224>)
  * Factorize differential mode processing (#219 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse/issues/219>)
    * Factorize differential mode processing
    * Throttle log message when transform message fails
  * Target frame optional (#217 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse/issues/217>)
    * Make target_frame optional
    * Remove optional target_frame parameters in tests
  * Transform message in differential mode (#216 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse/issues/216>)
    * Transform message in differential mode
    This is important because the relative transformation is not the same if
    the sensor and target frame are different.
    Consider for example the case of an IMU sensor upside down:
    * The robot base frame is base_link
    * The IMU sensor frame is imu_link
    * The imu_link transformation wrt base_link is 180 degrees wrt the y or
    x axis
    * The angular velocity around the z axis has opposite sign in the
    sensor frame wrt the target frame
    * Require pose_target_frame in differential mode
    * Roslint
    * Add pose_target_frame to optimizer test config
  * Use fuse_core::getPositiveParam for all ros::Duration parameters (#212 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse/issues/212>)
    * Use fuse_core::getPositiveParam for ros::Duration
    * Use fuse_core::getPositiveParam for TF durations
  * Add tcp_no_delay parameter to sensor models (#211 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse/issues/211>)
  * Add ability to throttle covariance computation (#209 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse/issues/209>)
  * Add invert_tf to Odometry2DPublisher (#206 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse/issues/206>)
    This allows to publish the inverse TF transform.
    This can be useful to skip the odom->base_link lookupTransform() when
    braodcasting map->base_link, which must be broadcasted as map->odom
    because TF tree doesn't support more than a single parent per frame,
    base_link in this case. This is particular relevant when
    predict_to_current_time is enabled, because the lookupTransform() could
    take a while, causing delays.
  * Support throttling serialized graph publisher (#204 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse/issues/204>)
    * Change sensor proc from gtest to gmock target
    * Move ThrottledCallback to fuse_core
    * Support generic callbacks in ThrottledCallback
    * Throttle graph publishing
    * Overload getPositiveParam for ros::Duration
    * Use getPositiveParam for ros::Duration parameters
  * Add linear acceleration to synchronizer (#205 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse/issues/205>)
  * Use local latest_stamp in notifyCallback (#203 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse/issues/203>)
  * Use dedicated spinner for publish timer callback (#201 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse/issues/201>)
    * Use dedicated spinner for publishTimerCallback
    * This reduces the jitter in the output topics and TF transform stamp
    because it allows the notifyCallback and publishTimerCallback to run
    concurrently. The notifyCallback might take longer than the timer
    period sometimes, mostly because the covariance computation is an
    expensive operation.
    * There is a subtle change of behaviour with this implementation!
    Before, the publishTimerCallback overwrote the odom_output_ and
    acceleration_output_ with the predicted state. Now it does not, and
    if it gets called twice or more times consecutively, it predicts since
    the last time the state was computed and updated in the
    notifyCallback. With the notifyCallback and publishTimerCallback
    running concurrently it is not trivial to keep the previous behaviour
    efficiently, because we would have to lock the entire callbacks to
    avoid the publishTimerCallback to overwrite a new state being computed
    concurrently in the notifyCallback. That being said, the predicted
    state is likely the same in both implementation. That is, the result
    is likely the same if we use multiple steps or a single one to predict
    the last state forward to the current time.

    * Fix wrapAngle2D expected range to [-Pi, +Pi)

    * Add print method to Unicycle2D

  * Minor typo fixes (#155 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse/issues/155>)
  * Get minimum_pose_relative_covariance_diagonal (#150 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse/issues/150>)
    Regardless of the value of independent, because the
    fuse_models::Odometry2D sensor model checks for use_twist_covariance
    before independent, and we could end up with an uninitialized
    minimum_pose_relative_covariance_diagonal.
  * Support ScaledLoss (#141 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse/issues/141>)
  * Remove duplicated roslint build_depend (#146 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse/issues/146>)
  * Remove old acceleration_2d folder (#145 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse/issues/145>)
  * Cleanup validation checks (#139 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse/issues/139>)
    * Add getCovarianceDiagonalParam helper
    This allows to load a covariance matrix from the parameter server,
    provided in a list with the diagonal values.
    * Add isSymmetric and isPositiveDefinite helper functions
  * Use twist covariance for differential dependent (#138 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse/issues/138>)
    In the fuse_models::Odometry2D sensor model, when differential: true
    and independent: false, the relative pose covariance should NOT be
    computed from the consecutive absolute pose covariance matrices because
    they grow unbounded, so the resulting relative pose covariance suffers
    from numerical issues.
    Instead, we can use the twist covariance of the last pose to compute the
    relative pose covariance, using the time difference between the
    consecutive absolute poses.
    The only limitation is that we cannot throttle the input topics, because
    otherwise the twist covariance from the intermediate/throttled messages
    is missed. We'll have to throttle inside the sensor model, by
    integrating the intermediate messages.
  * Support dependent relative pose measurements (#137 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse/issues/137>)
    * Added a "dependent" covariance calculation option to the "differential" mode
    * Added an independent param that defaults to true to keep the current behaviour
    * Added a minimum_pose_relative_covariance_diagonal param that is added to the
    resulting pose relative covariance in order to guarantee that it's not zero or ill-conditioned.
  * Scale process noise covariance (#130 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse/issues/130>)
    * Scale process noise covariance
    This scales the process noise covariance pose by the norm of the current
    state velocity.
    A new parameter velocity_norm_min is added, that prevents the process
    noise scaling from setting the pose components to zero or a very small
    value that could lead to NaN or a rank deficient Jacobian in the problem
    solved, due to an ill-condition covariance for the process noise.
  * Better validation of partial measurement output (#131 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse/issues/131>)
    * Relax the default precision when validating the covariance matrix is
    symmetric.
    * Print the covariance matrix with Eigen::FullPrecision when the
    symmetry test fails with isApprox, so we can see the magnitude of
    the error.
    * Show source if validation fails
    * Changes from throwing/crashing to ROS_ERROR.
    * Add eigenvalues to non-PSD error check
    * Add disable_checks param to sensor models
  * Publish linear acceleration (#129 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse/issues/129>)
    * Publish linear acceleration
    * Also use linear acceleration if predicting to the current time if the
    new param predict_with_acceleration is true (default value).
  * Explicitly call boost::range::join (#128 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse/issues/128>)
    Otherwise we could get a compilation error due to an ambiguous overloaded join function when  some additional boost/algorithm headers are included.
  * Add fuse_loss pkg with plugin-based loss functions (#118 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse/issues/118>)
  * Validate partial measurements (#125 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse/issues/125>)
  * Don't read pose_target_frame if differential (#126 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse/issues/126>)
    If differential is true, the pose_target_frame is not used.
  * Only allow exact timestamp transformations (#123 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse/issues/123>)
  * Benchmark unicycle_2d state cost function (#121 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse/issues/121>)
    The benchmark targets are now only build if CATKIN_ENABLE_TESTING is ON,
    which means that benchmark is now a test_depend and not a depend.
    However, the benchmarks are NOT gtests, so they are built directly on
    catkin build, i.e. there is no need to run make run_tests after. For
    this reason, the find_package on benchmark is no longer REQUIRED,
    but QUIET instead. The benchmark is built only if the benchmark package
    is FOUND.
  * Removed the explicit '-std=c++14' compile flag (#119 <https://github.com/locusrobotics/fuse/issues/119>)
